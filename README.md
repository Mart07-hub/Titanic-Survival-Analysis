# Titanic Survival Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival...

##  Objectives
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Explore feature relationships using correlation heatmaps
- Visualize age distribution and survival patterns
- Generate group-based insights
- Share findings through clear, aesthetic charts and markdown storytelling

##  Key Insights
- **Gender mattered**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **Class influenced survival**: Passengers in 1st class had better odds of survival
- **Fare and survival** showed a slightly positive correlation
- **Age distribution** peaked around 25 years.

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Filled missing `Age` values with the median
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with the mode
- Dropped `Cabin` due to excessive missing data
- Converted categorical columns...

##  Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

- ##  What I Learned
- How to handle missing data
- How to interpret correlation coefficients
- How to tell a compelling story
- The efficiency of using categorical data
